# BookWish

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
run `ng e2e` to execute tests via [Protractor](https://protractor.angular.io/).

## Notes
I added e2e as an option since I fixed the protractor test, they don't really test any e2e application logic as I don't have 
a lot of experience with the tool, but at least it passes. :)
